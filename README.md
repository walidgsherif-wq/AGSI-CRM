## What's in milestone 1

- **Next.js 14 App Router** with TypeScript, strict mode, typed routes.
- **Tailwind CSS** with the AGSI brand tokens from §15 (`tailwind.config.ts`).
- **Shadcn-style UI primitives**: `Button`, `Card`, `Badge` under
  `src/components/ui/`.
- **Role-adaptive Sidebar** (`src/components/domain/Sidebar.tsx`) that
  filters nav items per the §7.1 matrix for all four roles.
- **Dev-only role switcher** — a dropdown in the sidebar footer (only
  rendered when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`) that sets an `agsi_dev_role`
  cookie so you can preview Admin / Leadership / BD Head / BD Manager
  without auth (auth lands in M3).
- **Route groups** `(auth)` and `(app)` with full placeholder pages for
  every sidebar item (Pipeline, Companies, Projects, Tasks, Insights, three
  heat-map sub-pages, Reports, Settings, Admin + 7 admin sub-pages).
- **RLS-style route guards** — `requireRole()` on pages restricted at the
  §7.1 layer (e.g. `/admin/*`, `/insights/maps/*`, `/pipeline`, `/tasks`,
  `/reports`). Hitting a blocked route returns 404 rather than leaking
  existence.
- **Supabase client stubs** — server + browser factories wired, ready for
  M2 to plug in.
- **Playwright smoke suite** (`tests/e2e/shell.spec.ts`) covering:
  - Root redirects to dashboard
  - Admin sees every sidebar item
  - BD Manager cannot see Admin / Reports / Maps
  - BD Manager hitting `/admin/users` → 404
  - Leadership cannot see Pipeline / Tasks but sees Reports

## What's in milestone 14

Pre-computed market insights from BNC uploads:

- **Migration `0040_generate_market_snapshot.sql`** —
  `generate_market_snapshot(p_upload_id uuid)` SECURITY DEFINER fn
  aggregates the §4.4 metric set into `market_snapshots`:
  projects-by-stage / -by-city / -by-sector, top-20 developers /
  contractors / consultants, awarded vs not, completion pipeline
  (12/24/36 mo), under-construction value averages, and the canonical
  stage funnel. Idempotent — re-runs delete the prior `snapshot_date`
  rows and rewrite. Admin-only.
- **Admin trigger** on `/admin/uploads/[id]` — new "Generate market
  snapshot" card visible on completed uploads. The BNC pipeline
  itself doesn&apos;t auto-run this in v1; admin clicks once after each
  upload.
- **`/insights` page** — admin / leadership / bd_head / bd_manager all
  visible (no role gate; the data is BNC-derived, not BD-confidential).
  - **Snapshot picker** defaults to most recent date; second
    "Compare to" picker enables snapshot-vs-snapshot diffs (each
    metric tile shows a +N / -N badge).
  - Cards: stage funnel, projects-by-stage with value, projects-by-
    city + by-sector, three top-20 leaderboards, awarded vs
    not-awarded, completion pipeline, under-construction value
    averages.

Empty-state when no snapshot has been generated yet links to the
admin trigger.

Deferred to v1.1 / M16 polish: auto-run snapshot from the BNC Edge
Function on upload completion (so admin doesn&apos;t need to click);
charts (currently table-only, no recharts on `/insights`).

## What's in milestone 13

The notification bell finally lights up. Notifications written by M5
BNC uploads, M9 inbound email unmatched-queue, M12 leadership-report
finalise, plus three new eval jobs from M13 itself, all surface in a
sidebar bell with unread count + dropdown + a full `/notifications`
inbox.

- **Three eval functions** (migrations `0038_stagnation_notification_engine.sql`
  + `0039_fix_eval_stagnation.sql`):
  - `eval_stagnation()` — fires `stagnation_warning` at warn-pct% and
    `stagnation_breach` at 100% per `stagnation_rules`. Owner +
    escalation role.
  - `eval_composition_warning()` — per BDM, fires when on-track for
    Driver A headline but missing Driver B/C composition sub-target.
  - `eval_composition_drift()` — mid-quarter early warning when
    developer-/consultant-ratio drifts off target (§3.12b). Audit
    log in `composition_drift_log` regardless of fire.
  All three are SECURITY DEFINER, dedup-aware, and admin-only.
- **`/admin/notifications-eval`** — admin trigger page with three
  Run-now cards + last-24h fan-out by type + active stagnation
  thresholds. v1 has no cron wrappers; thin Edge Function adapters
  can be added later if leadership wants the eval to run without admin
  intervention.
- **`NotificationBell.tsx`** — sidebar dropdown component. Polls every
  60 seconds for the latest unread count + recent 10 notifications.
  Click an item to open its `link_url` (auto-marks read); "Mark all
  read" + "View all" link to the inbox.
- **`/notifications`** — full inbox with filter (all / unread only)
  and type filter; mark-all-read; per-row mark-read.
- **`/settings/notifications`** — channel status (in-app enabled,
  email + WhatsApp deferred to v1.1) + a catalogue of every
  notification type the CRM emits with recipient and trigger.
- **E2E tests** (`m13-notifications.spec.ts`): admin sees eval page;
  bd_manager 404 on eval; all roles can reach /notifications and
  /settings/notifications.

Deferred to v1.1: email digest at 07:00 Asia/Dubai (Resend); WhatsApp
channel; Realtime push (currently 60-second polling); per-user opt-out
toggles per type.

## What's in milestone 12

Frozen monthly + quarterly leadership reports, end-to-end:

- **Generator** (migration `0036_generate_leadership_report.sql`) —
  `generate_leadership_report(uuid)` SECURITY DEFINER fn aggregates
  executive headlines, KPI scorecard (team rollup + per-BDM with BEI),
  ecosystem awareness (snapshot + monthly trend), heat-map frozen
  counts, pipeline movements, key-stakeholder progress, and the latest
  market snapshot reference into `leadership_reports.payload_json`.
  Idempotent on draft rows; refuses on finalised / archived.
- **Finalise + archive** (migration `0037_finalise_leadership_report.sql`) —
  admin-only RPCs that flip status (draft → finalised → archived). On
  finalise, fans out a `notifications` row to every active
  leadership-role user. No DELETE path (audit-of-record per §3.17).
- **Admin draft flow** — `/admin/reports`, `/admin/reports/new`,
  `/admin/reports/[id]/edit` with executive summary + per-stakeholder
  narrative editors and a Regenerate button.
- **Leadership viewer** (`/reports/leadership/[id]`) — visible to
  admin / leadership / bd_head; bd_manager 404. Renders every payload
  section. Drafts are admin-only (rest of the app sees them as 404).
  Leadership-only feedback editor on finalised reports; the existing
  `enforce_leadership_feedback_only` trigger from migration 0021
  blocks any other role from writing into the feedback column.
- **Archive list** (`/reports/leadership`) — finalised + archived rows
  with role-aware sort. Leadership sees an inbox-style "awaiting
  feedback first" order.
- **PDF export** — server-side `@react-pdf/renderer` document
  (`src/lib/reports/LeadershipReportPdf.tsx`) reachable at
  `/api/reports/leadership/[id]/pdf`. Generates on-demand from
  `payload_json` (which is frozen at finalise time, so the output is
  deterministic). Returns the PDF as a streamed download with a
  date-stamped filename.
- **Tests** (`tests/e2e/m12-leadership-reports.spec.ts`) — admin sees
  `/admin/reports` + `+ New report`; bd_head 404 on `/admin/reports`;
  leadership 404 on `/admin/reports/new`; leadership + bd_head see
  `/reports/leadership` archive heading; bd_manager 404 on archive and
  on a specific viewer URL.

New deps: `@react-pdf/renderer` (server-only render path).

Deferred to v1.1: storing the PDF in Supabase Storage at finalise time
(spec §5.6 mentions `pdf_storage_path`). On-demand generation gives the
same UX without the bucket-management overhead — easy to bolt on later
if leadership wants permanent download links.

## What's in milestone 11

Three heat maps under `/insights/maps/*`, all gated to admin /
leadership / bd_head (bd_manager → 404 per §17 risk register R-3,
preventing reverse-engineering of ecosystem data they shouldn&apos;t see):

- **Geographic** (`/insights/maps/geographic`) — stylised UAE SVG with
  city dots positioned via lat/lon. Dot size scales with stakeholder
  count; colour = dominant company type at that city. Filters: type,
  L-level (incl. L3+), active-projects status. Side panel ranks
  cities with per-type micro-breakdown and syncs hover with the map.
- **Level distribution** (`/insights/maps/level-distribution`) — one
  tile per stakeholder in the AGSI universe. Tile colour = current
  L-level (§15 palette). Click a tile → `/companies/[id]`. Highlight
  modes: all / L3+ / key stakeholders. Summary bar shows §3.16 Block A
  counts at each level vs the type-narrowed denominator.
- **Engagement freshness** (`/insights/maps/engagement-freshness`) —
  stakeholder × week matrix, last 26 weeks. Cells coloured per the
  §7.5.3 buckets: hot (≤14d), warm (15–45d), cooling (46–90d), cold
  (>90d / never). Cell colour reflects the freshness of the
  engagement that fell in that week relative to today. Filters: type,
  L-level, sort (by L-level / most-neglected), &ldquo;my accounts only.&rdquo;
  Side panel: Cooling &amp; Cold L3+ accounts ranked by days-since-touch.

All three support **PNG export** via the shared
`HeatMapExportButton` (html-to-image; pixelRatio 2; date-stamped
filename) so admins can drop snapshots into leadership reports.

E2E (`tests/e2e/m11-heat-maps.spec.ts`): admin / leadership / bd_head
see the Export button on each map; bd_manager hitting any of the three
URLs returns 404.

Deferred to M12 / v1.1: triangulation map (§7.5 footnote — defer until
ecosystem data warrants it).

## What's in milestone 10

- **Real-time event firing** (migration `0034_ecosystem_event_triggers.sql`) —
  AFTER INSERT triggers on `level_history`, `engagements`, `documents`
  automatically score qualifying rows by calling the existing
  `insert_ecosystem_event()` (from migration 0021). Per §3.16:
  - `level_history`: forward + credited transitions only (L0→L1=1pt,
    L1→L2=3, L2→L3=8, L3→L4=20, L4→L5=50).
  - `engagements`: call / meeting / email / site_visit / workshop = 1pt;
    document_sent = 2pt; spec_inclusion = 15pt.
  - `documents`: announcement = 10pt, site_banner_approval = 15pt,
    case_study = 10pt (non-archived only).
  - 7-day dedup, 0.5× multiplier on inactive companies (existing rules
    in `insert_ecosystem_event`).
  - Soft-delete cascade (existing): when source row is deleted,
    `is_void = true` flips on the matching ecosystem event.
- **`rebuild_ecosystem_awareness()`** — recomputes
  `ecosystem_awareness_current` for `current_date`. `theoretical_max =
  kpi_universe_sizes.total × 100` (= 78,900 per §3.16). Builds
  `by_company_type` / `by_level` / `by_city` jsonb breakdowns. Hooks into
  the existing `ecosystem-rebuild` pg_cron schedule (22:15 UTC nightly).
- **`backfill_ecosystem_events()`** — one-time replay of historical
  rows. Idempotent via `dedup_key UNIQUE`.
- **`ecosystem_top_contributors()` / `ecosystem_cooling_accounts()`**
  (migration `0035_ecosystem_summary_helpers.sql`) — read-side helper
  RPCs feeding the leadership panel. Both `SECURITY DEFINER` with
  explicit `bd_manager` block.
- **`/admin/ecosystem-rebuild`** — admin-only page with **Rebuild now**
  and **Run backfill** buttons + the latest snapshot stats.
- **`/insights/ecosystem`** — leadership / admin / bd_head page (§7.5
  visibility rules). `bd_manager` → 404. Renders:
  - Hero: lifetime + active scores against theoretical max with
    intellectually-honest *"5.3% of theoretical max"* framing per §3.16.
  - Trend chart (recharts area) — daily snapshot over 120 days, lifetime
    + active overlay.
  - Segmentation (recharts bar) with tabs for company type / L-level /
    city.
  - Top contributors (this 90-day window) and cooling accounts
    (lifetime > 0, active = 0) tables.
- **`EcosystemPanel.tsx`** — compact dashboard tile (admin / leadership /
  bd_head) with active vs lifetime stats and a 30-day spark line.
- **E2E tests** (`m10-ecosystem.spec.ts`) — `bd_manager` blocked from
  `/insights/ecosystem` and `/admin/ecosystem-rebuild`; other roles see
  the heading. Per the §17 risk register R-3 RLS-defence requirement.

Deferred to v1.1: per §3.16 "Top contributors / cooling" filters (by
quarter, by company type), PNG export of the trend chart for inclusion in
leadership reports (lands with M12 reports).

## What's in milestone 9

- **Performance review** (`/reports`, `/reports/performance-review/[userId]`) —
  per-BDM annual scorecard. Five sections per fiscal year:
  - BEI by quarter (tier badge + driver A/B/C/D pcts pulled from
    `bei_for_caller`).
  - Per-driver Q1-Q4 actuals vs target tables with RAG colouring.
  - Stakeholder composition by `company_type_at_time` per quarter.
  - Engagement freshness — engagements logged per quarter.
  - Level transitions ledger — full FY list of `level_history` rows where
    `owner_at_time = subject`.
- **Single-step level rule** (migration `0031_level_step_rule.sql`) — every
  level change is `±1` only. Enforced at three layers: a `CHECK` constraint
  on `level_change_requests`, the `change_company_level()` function, and
  the `approve_level_change_request()` function.
- **Kanban drag-and-drop** (`PipelineKanban.tsx`) — adjacent columns
  highlight on drag-over, dialog opens with target locked to the drop
  column. Native HTML5 dragstart/dragover/drop, no library.
- **Inbound email tracking** (migration `0032_email_tracking.sql`,
  `/api/inbound-email`, `/admin/inbound-email`) — Postmark Inbound webhook
  → matcher → `engagements` (type=email) + `engagement_emails`. Unmatched
  emails land in `inbound_email_unmatched` for admin review. AuthN via
  `INBOUND_EMAIL_SECRET` query-string token.
- **Engagement details drawer** (`src/components/domain/EngagementDetailsSheet.tsx`)
  — click any engagement row in `/companies/[id]/engagements` to slide a
  details sheet in from the right. Postmark-captured emails are read-only
  with a sanitized HTML body / plain-text toggle and an admin-only "Raw
  email data" section. Manual engagements are editable via the same drawer.
  Built on `@radix-ui/react-dialog`; HTML sanitised with `isomorphic-dompurify`.

## What's explicitly deferred

- **Email notifications** — deferred to v1.1 per §16 D-3. In-app only for v1.
- **WhatsApp channel** — v1.1 per prompt §1.
- **Email attachments** — captured-flag stored, file bytes deferred to v1.1.
- **AI features, mobile native, third-party CRM sync** — out of scope per §11.

## Running locally

```sh
# Node 22 (see .nvmrc). pnpm 10.
pnpm install

# Dev server
pnpm dev                 # http://localhost:3000 → redirects to /dashboard

# Typecheck / lint / build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build

# Playwright (first run installs browsers)
pnpm test:e2e:install
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. For M1 only
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ROLE_DEFAULT` actually matters — all other variables are
read by later milestones. Supabase URL + anon key become required at M2.
